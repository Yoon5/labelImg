LabelImg
========

Changed the original LabelImg tool to propagate the bounding boxes from one image to the other in a video extracted frame sequence, thereby reducing the effort to manually draw a bounding box on each and every image. This should help in annotating video sequences where the successive frames look very similar to the previous ones.
